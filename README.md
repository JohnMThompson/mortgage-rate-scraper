# mortgage-rate-scraper

This short Python script scrapes the interest rates from my local credit union website using the Beautiful Soup package and saves them to a MySQL database.

I also used this project to learn [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to schedule my script to run daily at 18:00 UTC on an Ubuntu Server.
